Hello. If you're reading this, you've probably tried to reach a donation page on a ROM I maintain.

Thing is, I don't accept donations made with money. The fact that you were curious enough to check out the ROM is enough of a support for me. Knowing there's someone else out there using my work brings me joy, and I'm grateful that you're here, reading this very page.

I know you didn't expect me to put a page like this in place of the donation URL, but it's just how I am, really.

That said, if you want to check out my other stuff, you may visit [my website](https://kurtbahartr.github.io), [my GitHub profile](https://github.com/kurtbahartr) or [my Telegram channel](https://t.me/b_builds).

Hope to see you soon!
